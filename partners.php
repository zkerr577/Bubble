We are currently working in Pittsburgh, PA, and Jacksonville and Wilmington, NC. Our current partners offer food packages, basic education, employment opportunities, and other great things to our fellow Americans in need. You don't have to be in the specific areas to partner with us, though we do ask that you have a location in the state you wish to assist. Please contact us with the email form below and be descriptive. We try to respond within 3 business days. We look forward to working with you!</p>
