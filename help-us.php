                        <p>We are always looking for more ways to help people in our communities! As you know, our workforce is entirely voluntary, we partner with businesses in local areas to provide goods and services, and this is only done with what donations we recieve. The more help we get from you, the more people we can help together. Please, consider working with us or make a donation to give a hand up to more people in need.</p>

                        <p>Currently Hand Up is operating in Pittsburgh, PA, Jacksonville, NC, and Wilmington, NC. We're only two men though and coordinating all of the support needed is very time consuming. We would love to have your help doing <!-- What positions do we have for volunteers and what are the job descriptions? -->. What we can offer you in return is <!-- What's the WIIFM for our volunteers? -->.</p>

                        <p><!-- I don't mind not taking a penny from this, but I think we would be hard pressed to find other that share that sentiment and put in as much effort in other cities. We have to find out what compensation we can offer for people helping expand our reach. Consider looking at The American Red Cross as a model. -->Homelessness isn't unique to any one area and naturally, we want to help as many people as possible. If you share this sentiment with us and want to help expand the project, we would love to have your help. Please send us an email with your resume and a general overview of the homeless problem and active projects/resources in your area and we will be in touch soon!</p>

                        <p>Hand Up is run entirely on your donations. These donations pay for food, shelter, basic education and training, local contracts, our operating costs and more. The average cost to Hand Up to reintegrate one person is <!-- Whenever we have an average of at least 5 people. -->. Here is how we calculate that. <!-- Link to disclosures, explain average, min, and max cost. --> Making a tax-deductible donation to Hand Up means that another person will be that much closer to being off the streets, in a home, working and living a normal life again.</p>
