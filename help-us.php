                        <p>We are always looking for more ways to help people in our communities! As you know we are a volunteer organization and we partner with businesses in local areas to provide goods and services using only your donations. The more help we get from you, the more people we can help together. Please, consider volunteering with us make a donation to give a hand up to more people in need.</p>

                        <p>Currently Hand Up is operating in Pittsburgh, PA, Jacksonville, NC, and Wilmington, NC. We're only two men though and coordinating all of the support needed is very time consuming. We would love to have your help doing <!-- What positions do we have for volunteers and what are the job descriptions? -->. What we can offer you in return is <!-- What's the WIIFM for our volunteers? -->.</p>

                        <p>We are always looking for good partners to help get good opportunities and necessities to those in need. If you're operating in an area that we are, please send us an email and let's see what we can do together!</p>

                        <p> I don't mind not taking a penny from this, but I think we would be hard pressed to find other that share that sentiment and put in as much effort in other cities. We have to find out what compensation we can offer for people helping expand our reach. Consider looking at The American Red Cross as a model. Homelessness isn't unique to any one area and naturally, we want to help as many people as possible. If you share this sentiment with us and want to help expand the project, we would love to have your help. Please send us an email with your resume and a general overview of the homeless problem and active projects/resources in your area and we will be in touch soon!</p>-->

                        <p>Hand Up is run entirely on your donations. These donations pay for food, shelter, basic education and training, local contracts, our operating costs and more. The average cost to Hand Up to assist one person is about $1000. Your donations pay for the food, shelter, and legal documents needed to get our fellow Americans back to living a normal life. Please consider making a donation today. <!-- Here is how we calculate that.  Link to disclosures, explain average, min, and max cost.  Making a tax-deductible donation to Hand Up means that another person will be that much closer to being off the streets, in a home, working and living a normal life again. --></p>
