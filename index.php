                <p>They are Americans in need, in the most plain terms. Over 550,000 real people that need real help. 35% of homeless Americans go unsheltered every night or about the entire population of Tallahassee, FL. About 40,000 veterans and 4,000 minors remain homeless every night in our country, and about 56,500 families with children live on the streets.</p>

                <h3 class="divTitle">What We Do</h3>

                <p>On day one, we get our homeless sheltered. We partner with local businesses, projects, agencies and municipalities to make the biggest impact as fast as possible. From there we work in the local area to get these people their identity back, keep them clean and healthy, and reintegrate them as quickly as possible into normal society. </p>

                <p>We're not just another charity. Hand Up was started by Drew Kerr while attending Duquesne Law School and his brother Zakary while he was serving as an active duty Marine EOD Technician. 100% of all funds recieved go towards our goal, helping those who need it the most. Our all work force is all volunteer from the top down and we are proud of it. It's one of two things that allows us to do as much as we do. The other is you.</p>
