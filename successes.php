                <p class="space center">We've met many great people doing what we've been doing. A lot of great Americans that only needed a hand up to get back to normalcy. We never ask anything in return of the people that we help, except that they be healthy, productive, and that they do what they can to share these opportunities with those in need that they find. Here, we would like to share with you a few of the people that we have been so lucky to meet and have helped get back to a state of independence.</p>

Regrettably, we cannot help everyone that we meet that needs it. It's simply a matter of resources and capability. The people that we have been successful in helping have followed a path of growth that has led them to full independence as a happy, healthy, productive member of society. We are very proud of our *success rate*, and though it may not be 100%, it would be worth it if we could only help one person.</p>
