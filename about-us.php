                <p>Drew had the idea for Hand Up in his second year at Duquesne Law School. He started another successful charity while finishing his bachelors, Castaway Companions, where he helped all the cats get homes. In his spare time he enjoys reading penal codes, playing drums and talking to homeless people.</p>

                <p class="space">All we need is legit photos and custom text for you. I'm sure I'll change my text a time or two, but I figured I'd make it a little personal as well as descriptive.</p>

                <p>I started to help bring the idea to life as a deployed Marine using what I taught myself of web development and learning a lot more. I helped make the website and established a social media presence for Hand Up, as well as started the first Hand Up efforts in North Carolina. Starting in Jacksonville and Wilmington, NC, with the help of a number of local businesses and law enforcement, Hand Up has identified over 300 people in need in Jacksonville alone.</p>
                
                <p>My full time job is as an active duty EOD Technician in the United States Marine Corps. Currently, I am a sergeant with almost 8 years in service. In my spare time, I enjoy learning languages, currently French and Italian, and being fascinated by just about anything technological, I am also learning game development and love learning about other technologies. When I'm not doing any of that, I do what I truly enjoy the most; Spend time with my wife and daughter.</p>
