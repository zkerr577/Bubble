                    <h3 class="divTitle">Pre Program</h3>
                    <p>We've partnered with local law enforcement in our areas to help identify areas of concern and it is in these locations that we take it upon ourselves to find and interact with the homeless population. Unfortunately we can't help everyone and not everyone wants our help, but those that do talk to us and have interest in what we offer go through a simple background check. When they pass that, we can move on to the next phase.</p>

                <div class="center space">
                    <h3 class="divTitle">Phase I</h3>
                    <p>In the first phase, we do three things immediately. We get them into a home, where they can eat and clean themselves. If a home is not available on the first night, we get them into a guaranteed spot at a shelter that has partnered with us. How we accomplish this is by coordinating with local churches and other efforts to get these people into a regular living situation as soon as possible. The idea behind this is that when they leave that temporary situation, it should be the last time that they are in one like that. Food is provided by local grocers until they can afford their own along with basic hygiene products. If necessary, Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are made available to the individual.</p>

                    <h3 class="divTitle">Phase II</h3>
                    <p>The second phase begins as soon as possible and this involves getting the individual official identification again and introducing them to community involvement and education opportunities such as public libraries and churches. Getting official ID may be difficult, but it is required to conduct business and gain employment. We do everything we can to make this process easy for the individual to carry out. Spiritual health and developent is also an important part of this process, which is why we encourage the individuals to go and become a part of these wonderful communities. Libraries offer more than community involvement opportunities, but also a plethora of free education opportunities.</p>

                    <h3 class="divTitle">Phase III</h3>
                    <p>The final phase is employment. As soon as they acquire official ID, they are ready to start looking for work. Of course, they can work wherever they so please, this is America after all. We do try to establish and promote a network of businesses in the areas we operate that have available openings and offer special training where possible. After they gain employment, we assist them in anyway we can to find their own housing and set them up for financial stability and succcess.</p>

                    <h3 class="divTitle">Post Program</h3>
                    <p>Even if everything has gone off without a hitch so far, it's not over there. We do stay in touch with everyone that we've had the opportunity to help to answer any questions they may have, offer advice when we can, and to generally just stay in touch. After all, this isn't just some food and a check, the goal here is to build a community of strong, compassionate individuals that know how to help someone because they know how to help themselves.</p>
